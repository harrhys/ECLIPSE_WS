      <p>Complete <b><a href="docs/list.html">index of sample applications</a></b> 
        provided as part of the application server. <br>
        <b><br>
        Getting Started Guide&nbsp;</b> 
      <p>Before working with the samples, ensure that you've followed the Getting 
        Started Guide in order to familiarize yourself with the features and basic 
        operation of the application server. The Getting Started Guide is available 
        at <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;install_dir&gt;/docs/getting-started/index.html 
        </font><br>
        <b><br>
        Before Working With Samples</b> 
      <blockquote>In addition to following the Getting Started Guide, it is recommended 
        that you review the following sections prior to working with the sample 
        applications. 
        <p><b><a name="setup-env"></a>1. Set Up Your Environment</b> <br>
          Before deploying sample applications to Sun ONE Application Server, 
          ensure your application server environment is functioning properly. 
          The basic operations introduced in the Getting Started Guide will help 
          ensure that your environment is configured properly. A key requirement 
          prior to working with the samples is to ensure that the following directory 
          is added to your PATH environment variable: 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;install_dir&gt;/bin</font> 
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you are either sharing your application server installation with 
          other users or using a user ID that does not have write permissions 
          to the area in which the application server is installed (for example, 
          a non root user using an application server installed under<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> 
          /usr/appserver/ </font>on Solaris[tm] 9), you should make a copy of 
          the sample applications in your own directory before working with the 
          samples. For more information on creating your own samples environment, 
          see the section <a href="docs/setupenv.html"><b>Creating Your Own Samples 
          Environment</b></a>.
        <p>If you are using the application server that is installed as part of 
          a Solaris 9 installation, you will need to download and install PointBase 
          if you intend to use the sample applications that depend on JDBC[tm] 
          to access a database. Follow the steps in <b><a href="docs/pointbase.html">Using 
          PointBase with the Samples</a></b> section for instructions on downloading, 
          installing and configuring PointBase for use with the sample applications. 
          Alternatively, you can use an Oracle database server by following the 
          section below that addresses how to use Oracle with the samples. 
        <p><b><a name="directory-structure"></a>2. Review Samples Directory Structure</b> 
          <br>
          The sample applications included in the application server installation 
          are packaged according to a consistent structure. Each sample's directory 
          structure represents a typical source code directory structure layout. 
          For more information on the manner in which the samples are organized, 
          see the section <b><a href="docs/packaging.html">Samples Directory Structure</a></b>. 
        <p><b><a name="using-ant"></a>3. Review Using Ant with the Samples&nbsp;</b> 
          <br>
          All of the samples include <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">build.xml</font> 
          files that enable you to use the Java[tm]-based Ant build facility to 
          easily recompile, reassemble and redeploy the sample applications. For 
          more information on using Ant with the samples, see the section <b><a href="docs/ant.html">Using 
          Ant with the Samples</a></b>. 
        <p><b><a name="using-pointbase"></a>4. Review Using PointBase with the 
          Samples</b> <br>
          When the PointBase database server is installed as part of the application 
          server installation, the database server includes a prepopulated database 
          containing the tables and data required by the sample applications. 
          For more information on how to use PointBase with the samples, see the 
          section <b><a href="docs/pointbase.html">Using PointBase with the Samples</a></b>. 
          This section also addresses how to download, install and configure the 
          PointBase server when you are using the application server that is installed 
          as part of a Solaris 9 installation. 
        <p><b><a name="using-oracle"></a>5. Review Using Oracle with the Samples</b> 
          <br>
          The samples which require database&nbsp;connections can also work with 
          an Oracle RDBMS. For more information on how to use an Oracle RDBMS 
          with the samples, see the section <b><a href="docs/oracle.html">Using 
          Oracle with the Samples</a></b>. <br>
        <p>&nbsp;

      <p><b>Obtaining Assistance</b> </p>

        Sample Applications topic in the Sun ONE Application Server 7 area of
