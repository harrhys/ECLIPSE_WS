     Generally,the steps for develomentof  C++ client are
       1) Generate idl from the java class files using rmic -idl option
       2) Generate the c++ stubs, skeletons.
       3) Implementate the valuetypes in C++. Normally, the idl compiler 
          will provide the option to generate a dummy implementation.
       4) Compile and link with ORB libraries to generate the binary.

      Sometimes the idl files (generated by rmic) and c++ stubs and skeletons (generated by idl compiler) will not compile directly. They have to be hand modified for successful compilation. Also, some of the valuetype implementations have to be handcoded. Following are the files that are hand modified.

Files modified for compilation/generation
----------------------------------------
     1) java/lang/Exception.idl
     2) java/lang/StackTraceElement.idl
     3) java/lang/Throwable.idl
     4) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/Employee.idl
     5) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/InterfaceTest.idl
     6) All .h and .cpp files under org/omg/boxedRMI/CORBA and javax/rmi/CORBA
     7) java/lang/Ex.[hc]*


Valuetype implementations
------------------------

     1) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/Employee_impl.h
     2) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/Employee_impl.cpp
     3) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/ComplexObject_impl.cpp
     4) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/ComplexObject_impl.h
     5) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/InterfaceTestClass_impl.cpp
     6) samples/rmi_iiop/cpp/ejb/InterfaceTestClass_impl.h

     These hand modified file are not generated as part of building this sample.     Other files are generated as part of build process. 

     The above list of files should not be modified.
