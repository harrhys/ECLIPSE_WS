/**
 * A base class for GUI actions that do their work asynchronously on
 * a <code>WorkQueue</code> thread.  It's intended to be used to
 * create singleton instances of subclasses that will become the
 * value of the <code>Action</code> property of a Swing component.
 * Subclasses should override the <code>request</code>,
 * <code>response</code>, and <code>handleException</code>
 * methods.  The <code>request</code> will be run on the
 * <code>WorkQueue</code> thread, the other methods will be run
 * on the event dispatching thread.  Here's an example:
 * <pre>
 * ServerAction myAction = new ServerAction("MyAction") {
 *     protected Object request(ActionEvent e) {
 *         return myServer.doMyRequest();
 *     }
 *     protected void response(Object requestValue) {
 *         myGUI.showResponse(requestValue);
 *     }
 *     protected void handleException(Exception e) {
 *         myGUI.showException(e);
 *     }
 * };
 * JButton myButton = new JButton(myAction);
 * </pre>
 * In this example <code>'myServer.doMyRequest()'</code> will run
 * on the <code>WorkQueue</code> thread and, when it returns,
 * <code>'myGUI.showResponse(requestValue)'</code>
 * will run on the event dispatching thread.  The
 * <code>showResponse</code> argument, <i>requestValue</i>,
 * is the value returned by the <code>response</code> method.
 * If the <code>request</code> method throws an exception,
 * then <code>handleException</code> is called on the
 * event dispatching thread, instead of <code>response</code>.
